# Introduction

Visualising data is an essential part of communicating messages and results to any form of audience. An ineffective visualisation of data can communicate a very misleading message. 

Building skills in data visualisation can help you to understand and see important results in other peopleâ€™s tables, graphs, and maps. This is in addition to enabling you to create informative visualisations of your own.

The aim of this document is to provide comprehensive guidance on the presentation of data in tables, graphs, and maps. This will include both general guidance and more specific advice on different types of visualisations. We intend to provide some principles of good graphical, tabular, and cartographic practice. By providing this advice, we hope to assist anyone in their future work, especially when it comes to the writing up of research results for an audience.  

This guide is intended for anyone who wishes to develop their data visualisation and reporting skills. The advice presented here will be applicable to a wide variety of situations and is not specific to certain topics. Additionally, we hope that users of all ability levels will be able to take this advice to mind in their future projects and their everyday interactions with data.

This resource will start by exploring some general guidance on the presentation of data before going into more specific detail on the use of tables, graphs and maps (an increasingly popular method of presenting data). It then provides advice on ensuring your visualisations are accessible, with consideration on the use of colour.
